## 📌 Background
In the palm oil production process, one crucial aspect that must be considered is the ripeness level of the oil palm fruit. This ripeness level plays a vital role in determining the quality and quantity of the oil produced. Harvesting the fruit at the optimal stage of ripeness results in high oil yield and the best quality.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- ### Ripeness Detection
  Detecting the ripeness level of oil palm fruit, which includes several stages: unripe, under-ripe, ripe, and rotten.
- ### Increasing Efficiency
  This application aims to increase the efficiency of ripeness sorting.

---

## ✅ Benefits
- Assisting farmers in detecting the ripeness level of oil palm fruit quickly and accurately.

## 📁 Dataset
